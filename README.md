# Analysis-Mars_Orbital-Images

In this project, I explore the application of a manifold learning technique called epsilon-ISOMAP and
a dimensionality reduction technique called principal components analysis (or PCA) on a dataset
consisting of orbital images of Mars in order to capture significant features of the images. I also
identify some images considered outliers based on the adjacency matrix used in epsilon-ISOMAP.
Finally, I apply several classification models, some linear and some non-linear, and compare their
performance.
